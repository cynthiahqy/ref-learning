# Notes

## CH01: Modifying a program
* Programming is editing text
* Code and data

### 1.1 Appropriating a Page
text generation
1. [perverbs.html](http://nickm.com/poems/perverbs.html)
* 
2. [upstart.html](http://nickm.com/poems/upstart.html)
* splits and rejoins tech start-up names
3. [lede.html](http://nickm.com/poems/lede.html)
4. [love_letters.html](http://nickm.com/poems/love_letters.html)
5. [stochastic_texts.html](http://nickm.com/poems/stochastic_texts.html)
6. [a_house_of_dust.html](http://nickm.com/poems/a_house_of_dust.html)
* A HOUSE OF material, place, USING light_source, INHABITED BY inhabitants

### 1.2 Quick and Easy Modifications
1. code vs. data
* change data strings, numbers (usually doesn't break the program unless divide by 0?)
* change speed of production 
- simplify program: e.g. remove parts
- change output of program: e.g. change tone, syntax,

## CH01: Modifying a simple text machine

Sun 27 Aug 2017 [3 hrs]
 
* made mine-thesis_titles.html

Had problems with copy original code for stanza() function. 
Originally typed it by hand, but after populating the screen, it would not remove the firstChild.
tried replacing tabs with spaces, didn't help
yanked and modified code from a_house_of_dust.html which solved the problem.

- maybe try typing out code again and doing vimdiff on it

## CH02: Calculating
* valid code vs. intentional code
CH02-calculating.ipynb


## CH03: Double Double
* whitespace is meaningful in python
	* always use 4 spaces NOT a tab
