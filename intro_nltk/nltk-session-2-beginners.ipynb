      "It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town,\n",
      "or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads and\n",
      "cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three,\n",
      "four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for\n",
      "an alms. These mothers instead of being able to work for their honest\n",
      "livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg\n",

      "thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight\n",
      "for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of\n",
      "children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers,\n",
      "and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of\n",
      "the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore whoever\n",
      "could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these children\n",
      "sound and useful members of the common-wealth, would deserve so well of\n",
      "the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the\n",
      "children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall\n",
      "take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of\n",
      "parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand\n",
      "our charity in the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years, upon this\n",
      "important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of\n",
      "our projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their\n",
      "computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be\n",
      "supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment:\n",
      "at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may\n",
      "certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of\n",
      "begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for\n",
      "them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their parents,\n",
      "or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives,\n",
      "they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to\n",
      "the cloathing of many thousands.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will\n",
      "prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of\n",
      "women murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us,\n",
      "sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence\n",
      "than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and\n",
      "inhuman breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million\n",
      "and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand\n",
      "couple whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty\n",
      "thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children, (although\n",
      "I apprehend there cannot be so many, under the present distresses of\n",
      "the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain an hundred and\n",
      "seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand, for those\n",
      "women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or disease within\n",
      "the year. There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of\n",
      "poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How this number\n",
      "shall be reared, and provided for? which, as I have already said, under\n",
      "the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the\n",
      "methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft\n",
      "or agriculture; we neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor\n",
      "cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing\n",
      "till they arrive at six years old; except where they are of towardly\n",
      "parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier;\n",
      "during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as\n",
      "probationers: As I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the\n",
      "county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never knew above one or\n",
      "two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the kingdom so\n",
      "renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl before twelve years\n",
      "old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they\n",
      "will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown\n",
      "at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the\n",
      "parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at\n",
      "least four times that value.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will\n",
      "not be liable to the least objection.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in\n",
      "London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a\n",
      "most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted,\n",
      "baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a\n",
      "fricasie, or a ragoust.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the\n",
      "hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand\n",
      "may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males;\n",
      "which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my\n",
      "reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a\n",
      "circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will\n",
      "be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand\n",
      "may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and\n",
      "fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them\n",
      "suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat\n",
      "for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for\n",
      "friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will\n",
      "make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will\n",
      "be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12\n",
      "pounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28\n",
      "pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for\n",
      "landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem\n",
      "to have the best title to the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Infant's flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful\n",
      "in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave\n",
      "author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick dyet,\n",
      "there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about nine\n",
      "months after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because\n",
      "the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom,\n",
      "and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening\n",
      "the number of Papists among us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar's child (in which\n",
      "list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers)\n",
      "to be about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe no\n",
      "gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good\n",
      "fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of excellent\n",
      "nutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or his\n",
      "own family to dine with him. Thus the squire will learn to be a good\n",
      "landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have eight\n",
      "shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she produces another\n",
      "child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may\n",
      "flea the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make\n",
      "admirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in\n",
      "the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not\n",
      "be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and\n",
      "dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues\n",
      "I highly esteem, was lately pleased, in discoursing on this matter, to\n",
      "offer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this\n",
      "kingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the\n",
      "want of venison might be well supply'd by the bodies of young lads and\n",
      "maidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so great\n",
      "a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for\n",
      "want of work and service: And these to be disposed of by their parents\n",
      "if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due\n",
      "deference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I\n",
      "cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my American\n",
      "acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was\n",
      "generally tough and lean, like that of our school-boys, by continual\n",
      "exercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not\n",
      "answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think, with\n",
      "humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because they soon would\n",
      "become breeders themselves: And besides, it is not improbable that some\n",
      "scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice, (although\n",
      "indeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty, which, I\n",
      "confess, hath always been with me the strongest objection against any\n",
      "project, how well soever intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient\n",
      "was put into his head by the famous Salmanaazor, a native of the island\n",
      "Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago, and in\n",
      "conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young person\n",
      "happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to persons\n",
      "of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body of a\n",
      "plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison the\n",
      "Emperor, was sold to his imperial majesty's prime minister of state, and\n",
      "other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet, at four\n",
      "hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the same use were\n",
      "made of several plump young girls in this town, who without one single\n",
      "groat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without a chair, and appear\n",
      "at a play-house and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will\n",
      "pay for; the kingdom would not be the worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast\n",
      "number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I have\n",
      "been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to ease\n",
      "the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the least pain\n",
      "upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they are every day\n",
      "dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast\n",
      "as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young labourers, they\n",
      "are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot get work, and\n",
      "consequently pine away from want of nourishment, to a degree, that if\n",
      "at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour, they have not\n",
      "strength to perform it, and thus the country and themselves are happily\n",
      "delivered from the evils to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I\n",
      "think the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and\n",
      "many, as well as of the highest importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the\n",
      "number of Papists, with whom we are yearly over-run, being the principal\n",
      "breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who\n",
      "stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the\n",
      "Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good\n",
      "Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than stay at\n",
      "home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own,\n",
      "which by law may be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their\n",
      "landlord's rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and money a\n",
      "thing unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, Whereas the maintainance of an hundred thousand children,\n",
      "from two years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than\n",
      "ten shillings a piece per annum, the nation's stock will be thereby\n",
      "encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a\n",
      "new dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the\n",
      "kingdom, who have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate\n",
      "among our selves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and\n",
      "manufacture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings\n",
      "sterling per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the\n",
      "charge of maintaining them after the first year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns,\n",
      "where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best\n",
      "receipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their\n",
      "houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves\n",
      "upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands\n",
      "how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they\n",
      "please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise\n",
      "nations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and\n",
      "penalties. It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards\n",
      "their children, when they were sure of a settlement for life to the\n",
      "poor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their annual profit\n",
      "instead of expence. We should soon see an honest emulation among the\n",
      "married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the\n",
      "market. Men would become as fond of their wives, during the time of\n",
      "their pregnancy, as they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in\n",
      "calf, or sow when they are ready to farrow; nor offer to beat or kick\n",
      "them (as is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition\n",
      "of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel'd beef: the\n",
      "propagation of swine's flesh, and improvement in the art of making good\n",
      "bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs,\n",
      "too frequent at our tables; which are no way comparable in taste or\n",
      "magnificence to a well grown, fat yearly child, which roasted whole will\n",
      "make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor's feast, or any other publick\n",
      "entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being studious of\n",
      "brevity.\n",

      "['Smog is a type of air pollutant. The word \"smog\" was coined in the early 20th century as a portmanteau of the words smoke and fog to refer to smoky fog.[1] The word was then intended to refer to what was sometimes known as pea soup fog, a familiar and serious problem in London from the 19th century to the mid 20th century. This kind of visible air pollution is composed of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, ozone, smoke or particulates among others (less visible pollutants include carbon monoxide, CFCs and radioactive sources). Man-made smog is derived from coal emissions, vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, forest and agricultural fires and photochemical reactions of these emissions.', 'Modern smog, as found for example in Los Angeles, is a type of air pollution derived from vehicular emission from internal combustion engines and industrial fumes that react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog. In certain other cities, such as Delhi, smog severity is often aggravated by stubble burning in neighboring agricultural areas. The atmospheric pollution levels of Los Angeles, Beijing, Delhi, Mexico City, Tehran and other cities are increased by inversion that traps pollution close to the ground. It is usually highly toxic to humans and can cause severe sickness, shortened life or death.', '', '', 'Coinage of the term \"smog\" is generally attributed to Dr. Henry Antoine Des Voeux in his 1905 paper, \"Fog and Smoke\" for a meeting of the Public Health Congress. The July 26, 1905 edition of the London newspaper Daily Graphic quoted Des Voeux, \"He said it required no science to see that there was something produced in great cities which was not found in the country, and that was smoky fog, or what was known as \\'smog.\\'\"[2] The following day the newspaper stated that \"Dr. Des Voeux did a public service in coining a new word for the London fog.\" However, this is predated by a Los Angeles Times article of January 19, 1893, in which the word is attributed to \"a witty English writer.\"', \"Coal fires, used to heat individual buildings or in a power-producing plant, can emit significant clouds of smoke that contributes to smog. Air pollution from this source has been reported in England since the Middle Ages.[3] London, in particular, was notorious up through the mid-20th century for its coal-caused smogs, which were nicknamed 'pea-soupers.' Air pollution of this type is still a problem in areas that generate significant smoke from burning coal, as witnessed by the 2013 autumnal smog in Harbin, China, which closed roads, schools, and the airport.\", 'Traffic emissions â such as from trucks, buses, and automobiles â also contribute.[4] Airborne by-products from vehicle exhaust systems cause air pollution and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities.[5][6][7][8]', 'The major culprits from transportation sources are carbon monoxide (CO),[9][10] nitrogen oxides (NO and NOx),[11][12][13] volatile organic compounds,[10][11] sulfur dioxide,[10] and hydrocarbons.[10] (Hydrocarbons are the main components of petroleum fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel.) These molecules react with sunlight, heat, ammonia, moisture, and other compounds to form the noxious vapors, ground level ozone, and particles that comprise smog.[10][11]', 'Photochemical smog is the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, which leaves airborne particles and ground-level ozone.[14] This noxious mixture of air pollutants may include the following:', 'A primary pollutant is an air pollutant emitted directly from a source. A secondary pollutant is not directly emitted as such, but forms when other pollutants (primary pollutants) react in the atmosphere. Examples of a secondary pollutant include ozone, which is formed when hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) combine in the presence of sunlight; nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is formed as nitric oxide (NO) combines with oxygen in the air; and acid rain, which is formed when sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides react with water.[15] All of these harsh chemicals are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. Photochemical smog is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialization. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles.[16] Because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well.']\n"
